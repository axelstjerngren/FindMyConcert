# FindMyConcert


Welcome to FindMyConcert!
This is a university project created by Ollie Gardner, Axel Stjerngren, Robert Pringle, Patryk Kaczmarczyk and Andrew Finlayson for the Web Application Development course 
at the University of Glasgow. The premise of the website is to allow users to find concerts in their 
local area and for venues to be able to easily add new concerts.

If you don't want to run the site locally then you can visit FindMyConcert @ https://findmyconcert.pythonanywhere.com

## Installation

First clone the repository and then navigate to the FindMyConcert source folder.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py makemigrations concert

python manage.py migrate
```

(Optional) Now you can run the population script. Please note that db.sqlite3 has to be deleted each time you run this script as the database does not allow duplicate entries.
```
python population_script.py
```

Now run the server!
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now if you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ you should be greeted by a view which looks like this:

### The maths behind the discover page

The discover page recommends you artists which you have not yet bookmarked. It recommends these artists by correlating your ratings with other users who have rated concerts in a similar fashion as you.

The recommender engine uses a mathematical operation called singular value matrix decomposition (henceforth SVD). All user ratings are stored in a  matrix where each row represents a unique user and each column represents a unique artist. Missing ratings (all occurrences where a user has not rated a user) are called latent factors. Most ratings in the matrix are latent factors, so the matrix is a sparse matrix.

![Singular Value Decomposition](http://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0607/recommend/recommender/images/svd2.png)

In SVD the ratings matrix (xÌ‚) is decomposed into three lower dimensional matrices. U is the matrix which represents the relationship between users and latent factors. S is a diagonal matrix which (essentially) represents the weights of each rating. The last matrix VT is a right singular matrix, this represents the relationship between artists and the latent factors. We decompose the ratings matrix with a rank K = 5 and then multiply U, S and VT  back together to get the rank K approximation of the ratings matrix. 

Now all the latent factors are filled in with a value which should approximately represent the rating each user would have given the artist in question. Now a row which represents a user can be extracted, transposed and sorted to find teh aritists which the user might enjoy.

One issue is that these matrices are not automatically generated, so new users and artists require that a special script is run to ensure that the matrix includes all the new data.

```
python update_ratings.py
```
### Compact Mode

- The compact/pretty mode button switches between the two modes
- The webapp is set to pretty mode by default
- The preferred mode is saved in the user model (so only logged in users can switch modes)
- This mode shows concerts in a more concise way, as demonstrated below.

### Dark Mode

- The button to switch between light and dark mode is in the user dropdown
- The webapp is set to light mode by default
- Again, the preferred mode is saved in the user model
- This mode changes the CSS across the webapp to a dark theme
